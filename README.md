# 11.ISys-Textadventure

> There are no known bugs for the release. It is a beta release, errors can still occur. The minimum requirements for this task are met.

How to play the game:

- First you need to download the latest version, found on the right under 'Releases'.
- Then you need to open the zip - the folder 'assets' **needs** to be in the same directory as the .exe!
- At least you just need to open the .exe. Maybe your antivirus wants to block this but you can trust the application, there is no malicious code.
